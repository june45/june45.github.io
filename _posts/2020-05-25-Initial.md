# Initial Post - Setting Up Post Formatting

## Post Structuring
- Create Posts under the '_posts' and as a Markdown File (.md)
- Note .md files should be set as `YEAR-MONTH-DAY.filename.md` for Jekyll to read

## Markdown General Formatting tips
- Create a link to another .md file in Markdown `[links](https://www.markdownDirectory)`
- Format different headers using the `#, ##, ###` values at the beginning of a line
- For lists `-`, for numbers lists `1.`
- For quotations use `>`
- Images `![](/images/logo.png "fast.ai's logo")`. Save in the images folder
- Code ` ```languageType \n Write code``` `
- Tables `| Column 1 | Column 2 | \n | A thing | Another thing |`
