# CIFAKE: Real and AI-Generated Synthetic Images
## What is it?
- CIFAKE is a dataset that contains 60,000 synthetically-generated images and 60,000 real images (collected from CIFAR-10)

To get the CIFAKE Dataset and linking to Jupyter Workbook:
- Create Kaggle Account\
- profile page>account then Create a new API token (downloads a json file)
- In your codespace terminal ```mkdir ~/.kaggle``` 
- Drag the json find to your workspace and move to folder ```mv kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/```
- If permissions are needed: ```chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json```


# Using Deep Learning to differentiate between Real and Fake Images
## Training a small CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) on a the CIFAKE
General Methods include:
1. Loading the dataset
2. Build a small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
3. Train the CNN to detect real or fake photographs

# Findings from the model
- The codebase for the model was tested in Codespace. There was no GPU available however so the total runtime was significantly longer. 
- At the end of the run the following output was found:

| Column 1     |     Runtime      |    Loss    | Accuracy |precision_2| recall_2 | val_loss | val_accuracy|val_precision_2|  val_recall_2 |
