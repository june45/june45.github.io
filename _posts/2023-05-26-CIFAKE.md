# CIFAKE: Real and AI-Generated Synthetic Images
## What is it?
- CIFAKE is a dataset that contains 60,000 synthetically-generated images and 60,000 real images (collected from CIFAR-10)

# Using Deep Learning to differentiate between Real and Fake Images
## Training a small CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) on a the CIFAKE
General Methods include:
1. Loading the dataset
2. Build a small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
3. Train the CNN to detect real or fake photographs
