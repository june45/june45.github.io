# Introduction Notes About Fast Ai

## What is it?
Fastai is a high-level deep learning library built on top of PyTorch that aims to make deep learning more accessible and easier to implement. It was developed by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger, and it has gained significant popularity among researchers, students, and practitioners in the field of artificial intelligence.

- Deep Learning for Coders: Fastai focuses on providing practical tools and techniques for individuals who want to apply deep learning in real-world scenarios. The library is built around the "Deep Learning for Coders" course, taught by Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas, which emphasizes hands-on coding and real-world applications.

- Fastai v2: Fastai went through a major revamp with the release of version 2.0. The new version introduced a more modular and flexible design, making it easier to customize and extend the library's functionality. Fastai v2 also improved performance and added support for new features such as tabular data, natural language processing (NLP), and time series analysis.

- One-Cycle Policy: Fastai introduced the concept of the "One-Cycle Policy" for training neural networks. This approach involves training the model using a learning rate schedule that starts with a low learning rate, gradually increases it to a maximum value, and then decreases it again. This technique has been shown to improve training speed, convergence, and generalization performance.

- Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning: Fastai heavily emphasizes the use of transfer learning, which involves leveraging pre-trained models on large-scale datasets and fine-tuning them for specific tasks. The library provides easy-to-use functions and methods to perform transfer learning, allowing users to achieve impressive results with limited labeled data.

- Fastai Community: Fastai has a vibrant and supportive community of users. The Fastai forums serve as a hub for discussions, questions, and sharing experiences related to deep learning and the Fastai library. Jeremy Howard and other community members actively participate in discussions, providing valuable insights and guidance to users.
